# PRG02 5 MVC project

School project to dive into using frameworks for faster development. I will be using the Laravel framework for this project.

### Project description
Time tracker app for developers to keep track of their time per user stories/function requirements.

The roles are: project owners, project managers, developers.

Project owners can create projects and assign it to a development team. Development team has a project manager who can create user stories and add priorities/velocities for each story. 
Developers also has role levels. Each developer is assigned a role from 1 to 3 (with 1 being the junior developer). Developers can select one user story per turn based on their developer level and user story priority. Low level developers can not select high priority user story unless manually assigned by project manager.
